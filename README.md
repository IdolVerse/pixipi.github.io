# Pixipi — Seattle Virtual Idol Group

Official fan club website for **Pixipi**, a Seattle-based virtual idol group with a Win98 dreamcore / Tamagotchi aesthetic.

**Stack:** GitHub Pages (frontend) · Cloudflare Workers + D1 (backend + database) · Supabase Storage (images)


Events and albums share the same `events` table, distinguished by `kind = 'event' | 'album'`. The calendar and home page only show `kind = 'event'`; the gallery and admin can also manage albums.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler` (or use `npx wrangler`)
- A Cloudflare account with the Worker already deployed

### 1. Set up local secrets

Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `worker/.dev.vars` and fill in:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=any-local-secret
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

`DATABASE_URL` is no longer needed — the API uses Cloudflare D1.

### 2. Start the Worker locally (with remote D1)

```bash
cd worker && npx wrangler dev --remote
```

The `--remote` flag connects to the real D1 database on Cloudflare so you see live data. Without it, a local empty D1 is used.

Worker runs on **http://localhost:8787**.

### 3. Serve the frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd docs && python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. The frontend auto-detects `localhost` and points to `localhost:8787`.

### 4. Test it's running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/health
# → {"status":"Backend is running"}
```

---

## Cloudflare Secrets (production)

Set once via Wrangler — these are never stored in files:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

---

## Database

**Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) — bound as `DB` in the Worker.

- Database name: `pixipi-db`
- Apply schema: `npx wrangler d1 execute pixipi-db --file=schema.sql --remote`

### Schema summary

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | Admin accounts |
| `events` | Events (`kind='event'`) and photo albums (`kind='album'`) |
| `photos` | Photos linked to events/albums, stored in Supabase Storage |
| `videos` | YouTube/video links |
| `members` | Public member accounts (separate from admins) |
| `member_saved_events` | Events saved by members |
| `member_saved_photos` | Photos saved by members |
| `member_checkins` | Event check-ins |
| `member_messages` | Fan messages per idol |
| `member_cheers` | Anonymous cheer counts per idol |

## Deployment

**Frontend:** Push to `main` — GitHub Pages serves `docs/` automatically.

**Backend:** Deploy the Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
cd worker && npx wrangler deploy
```

---

## Production Checklist

- [x] CORS restricted to `pixipi.github.io` and `localhost`
- [x] Images stored in Supabase Storage (persistent)
- [x] Database on Cloudflare D1 (no cold start)
- [x] Photo/poster uploads auto-compressed to 1500px before storage
- [x] Photo delete cleans up Supabase Storage file
- [x] Member display name change updates JWT + all past messages
- [ ] Change default admin passwords
- [ ] Strong `JWT_SECRET` in production
- [ ] Add rate limiting to auth endpoints

---

## Troubleshooting

**Photos show as broken locally:** Supabase image transform API requires Pro plan. The site falls back to original URLs automatically via `onerror`.

**Upload fails locally (internal error):** Check `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `worker/.dev.vars`, then restart `wrangler dev --remote`.

**Calendar/list empty:** Make sure dates are stored correctly. SQLite uses `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format; the frontend uses `substring(0, 10)` to extract the date key.

**CORS errors in browser:** Access the site from `localhost` or `pixipi.github.io`, not `file://`.
